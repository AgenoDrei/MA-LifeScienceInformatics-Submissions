* Summary
	* MeSH (Medicial Subject Headings)
		* hierachical structured controlled vocabulary for indexing of medical articles (Exam!)
		* serves as a thesaurus to search articles
		* Relatedness between articles (shared references, index, semantics with token, **shared MeSH terms**, compare MeSH toxonomy)
		* create Citation networks
		* counts as Metadata for the article
* Ontologys
	* **Definition**: An ontology is the representation/formal naming/definition of the categories/properties/relations between the concepts/data/entities substituting one/many/all domains.
	* genus: an existing def. that serves as a portion of the new def.
	* differentiae: one attribute of a genus that differs members 
	* Example:
		* one genus: the genus for both a triangle and a quadrilateral: "A plane figure"
		* two differentiae: the differentia for a triangle: "that has 3 straight bounding sides.", the differentia for a quadrilateral: "that has 4 straight bounding sides."
	* formal specification of a shared conceptualization
	* taxonomy: a hierachy that uses the "is a" relation
	* ontologys are more losely organized
* FAIR: Findable, assesable, interoperable reusable
	* attributes that all data should have
* Bio Portal
	* list of all different kinds of ontologies (more than 7.000.000 classes)
* OWL
	* Web Ontology Language
	* used to capture knowledge in a computer readable format
	* Enhanced vocabulary (strong vocabulary), set of rules and actions to check input (Disjointness, quantification ...)
