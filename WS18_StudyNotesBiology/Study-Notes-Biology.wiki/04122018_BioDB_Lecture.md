* General knowledge
    * Neo-Angiogenesis: Formation of new blood vessels
    * Crystallization of Protein: Create a protein crystal
    * Luciferase: enzymes that produce bioluminescence
    * Onkogene: a gene that has the potential to cause cancer
    * Transfection: the process of deliberately introducing naked or purified nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells

* Pathways
    * Distinction is not always clear
    * they are not linear but branch out and run parallel actions
    * Signalling pathways: 
        * GPCRs activated transcription control
        * more short lived, convert smaller molecules -> change bigger ones
    * Metabolic pathways
        * linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell, often enzyme based
        * Catabolic: Releases energy
        * Anabolic: Uses energy
    * Biological process
    * Mechanism

* Pathway discovery
    * label cells with radioactive isotopes of carbon / nitrogen / phosphorus
    * Knockout specific genes that affect the pathways -> interfering with parts of it to get concrete knowledge (causality)
After knockout reintroduce them in a labeled form
    * crystallize proteins to see changes

* Tumor discovery
    * Transfer human tumor DNA to cell cultures / mouses
    * Test if the cells grow uncontrollably (or are immortal)
    * You need readouts / assays to investigate phenomena
    * Oncogenes are often in the signaling pathway (e.g. receptors that fire without binding ligand or other signal)

* Services EBI (REALLY IMPORTANT)

* Reactome
    * Highly curated pathway database
    * process driven / centric
    * Cell cylce, signal transmission, metabolism, disease, gene expression, immune system, â€¦

* WikiPathways
    * Crowdfunding inspired
    * gather collective knowledge from different specialists

* MetaboLights
    * Compound / Experiment centric
* Kegg Pathway Database
    * Metabolism, Genetic Information Processing
