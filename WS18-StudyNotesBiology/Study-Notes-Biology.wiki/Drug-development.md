## Report: Drug - target relationships 
Different drugs have to influence how the human body regulates itself or how diseases circumvent the natural defence systems. In the following sections the classical principle of the  "key and lock" metaphor will be explained, drug-target relationships defined and divided into different categories.

### Definition
A Drug-Target relationship is the chemical binding between a agent(called ligand, a small molecule) and a target molecule. These molecules are proteins or nucleic acid (in form of DNA/RNA) most of the time. The drug has to have the exact right form to fit into the so called binding pockets of the receptor. The same principle is also used naturally by the body for inter-cell communication or as a attack-vector for e.g. viruses.

The binding results in a so called protein-ligand complex. These bindings are much more complex than the key-lock image would suggest because the ligand as well as the target molecule can move and adapt their form to certain degree of freedom given by the specific chemical structure.

Most ligand bind non-covalent to their target structures. The most relevant interation types for this are: 

In a hydrogen bridge bond one subgroup (donor) has a very negative oxygen group and the acceptor usually ends in a proton (>NH or -OH group). The interaction does only happen because of the electrostatic differences. These connections often appear in combination with ionic interaction. Also some metal parts in the organic molecules can also make the binding much stronger. They can directly attract protons ore interact with pi-bonds which can found in benzene for example.
In addition to this direct interactions there also some indirect effects like the hydrophobic properties of some subgroups of the ligand. As soon as it binds to some macromolecule the water hull around the ligand collapses and releases energy which is more favourable for the complete system.  

### Classes & Examples
The bindings can be differentiated by the type of target they bind to. These classes can be found in this non-exhaustive table:

| Class name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Enzymes inhibitors             | Metabolism and many physiological regulations would not be possible without enzymes. They enable reactions that would usually need a higher pressure or higher temperature in the environment of a normal human body. It acts a catalyst that accelerates all kind of reactions and lowers the energy need to activate them. Multiple enzymes can work as a cascade after each other or in parallel(e.g. blood clotting). In diseased organisms you have to stop some of theses processes to avoid  disastrous consequences. The goal of enzymes inhibitors is exactly this: Stop the enzyme from kick-starting some specific reaction. There are two types of blockers: **Competitive** and **allosteric** inhibitors. The first group binds directly to the enzyme and blocks the place of the usual substrate. The second one bind to another section and change the three-dimensional structure of the molecule so much that the catalytic property gets reduced. There are reversible and irreversible blocker. | Acetylsalicylic acid (also known as aspirin) is an example for an irreversible allosteric inhibitor. It binds to the enzyme PGHS which usually produces hormones to regulate the inflammation response of the body and changes its 3D structure in a way that the raw material for the production of (prostaglandin) can no longer be processed because it does not fit into the enzyme anymore.                                                                                               |
| Receptor binder                | Receptors are proteins that regulate a wide range of different functions in an organism. Some of these are: Inter-cell information exchange (1), hormone controlled gene regulation (2) and control of specific ion channels that are embedded in the cell membrane (3).  Group 1 are neurotransmitter that are used by nerve cells to communicate (they are connected by synapses through which the chemical transmissions agents are distributed). These neurotransmitter bind to receptors of the receiving neurons and change their potential (which can result in a signal that will be propagated). In the nerve cell these receptors (GPCR) affect G-proteins which will start a process to activate other cells or ion channels. These are just one example there also process with free moving receptors which can directly interact with the DNA (2). The receptor encodes which part of the DNA Binding Domain shall be addressed.                                                                        | One example for receptor binding is insulin. Its task is to facilitate the uptake of sugar into cells of the body that use them to get energy. Insulin binds to receptors which results in the increase of a carrier protein (GLUT4) that transports the glucose in the surrounding cells. The liver and the brain do not depend on insulin because they use another transporter with a different activation mechanism.                                                                        |
| Carrier proteins blocker       | Carrier proteins have one important job in every organism: They help transporting amino acids and sugars into the cells which would not be possible without them. Also they support nerve cells in reabsorbing released neurotransmitter. Otherwise they would be removed by the metabolism which is not effective at all. Some drugs can replace normal carrier proteins and slow down the absorption process (cocaine stops dopamine from being reabsorbed).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | To further elaborate on the effect of cocaine you have to look at the usual dopamine usage process in the brain. Dopamine gets poured out and binds to the corresponding receptors which in essence make us feel good (or happy). After a time it is recycled back into the neurons by a special dopamine carrier protein. Cocaine binds to this protein and therefore stops the recycling process. Without removal the dopamine accumulates which results in euphoria typically for the drug. |
| Ioncanal interaction           | Agents can also affect ion channels which sit in the cell membrane directly (3). The channels let ions flow in and out of a cell to change its potential, they work similarly to a switch. If they open the cell gets "activated". This can result in muscle contractions or other cell related activities which can be regulated through control over the channels. Some drugs block these calcium channels to relax the muscles or have an narcotic effect. On the other side they can also open or stabilize the canals to improve ascular dilatation or push down blood pressure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Lidocaine is a local anesthetic used to numb specific areas. It blocks the Sodium Channels and stops the influx of positve Na+ ions. If these do get into the neural cell the whole process of a generation of an action potential can not occur. Therefore the stimulation of nerves (what we feel as pain) can not occur because they are not able to propagate a action potential to the nerves leading to the central nervous system.                                                      |
| Agent(e.g. viruses) inhibitors | For many viral, bacterial or parasitic diseases drugs tend to affect the causative organism directly.  Most of them try to destroy or disturb the normal cell process of the attacking agent. For example Quinolone antibiotics attack the DNA replication and transcription of bacteria cells so that they no longer can multiply. Other drugs directly change the DNA of cells to stop them from replicating directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Penicillin is a general antibiotic that attacks the cell membrane of different bacteria. These cell walls are stitched together by a certain enzyme (transpeptidase) which also accepts penicillin as a substrate. During normal cell division activities the bacteria just dies because the cell wall gets stretched too thin. The penicillin is more reactive than the usual substrate because of a unstable lactam ring structure in the molecule.                                          |
