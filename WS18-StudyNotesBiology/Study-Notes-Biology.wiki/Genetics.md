# Genetics knowledge notes

Here will be added everything I learned through videos, books or brain leeching from other persons.

## Proteins
A build up from 20 different Amino acids which form long chains. These chains can form secondary (hydrogen bonds), tertiary (hydrophobic and other forces between the rest groups of the acids)  and quaternary (forces between proteins) structures through different forces between the amino acids.  

### Protein Synthesis
* Transcription
    * Promoter shows where the transcription will start (TATAAAA)
    * Enzyme rna polymerase starts transcribing the DNA after the Tata-Box into the messenger RNA (mRNA) -> downstream (5' -> 3'), zips open DNA for reading
    * stops at the termination sequence
    * Start and end cap will  be added to mRNA
* Splicing
    * RNA Splicing does remove unnecessary parts from the mRNA
    * Snurbs marks parts that can be removed by Splicosome
    * Good stuff is called exons (will be expressed), bad stuff is called introns
    * mRNA moves now out of the cell nucleus
* Translation
    * mRNA goes into the Ribosome
    * rRNA has binding side that allows mRNA to interact with tRNA which does the production of amino acids
    * tRNA always matches to triplets of nucleotide acids and translates the triplet to a amino acids (codon + anticodon: bases)
    * amino acids can have multiple matching triplets
    * keeps sliding along the mRNA and producing a string of amino acids
    * can go one for thousands codons
* Folding
    * Primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary forces fold the protein to a functional form after sysnthesis

## Basics DNA and RNA
* DNA Structure
    * double helix, two strands running in opposite directions (upstream: 5' -> 3'), held to together by hydrogen bonds
    * build from nucleotides (A / T, C / G)
    * each nucleotide is build from Carbon sugar molecule, a phosphate group, 1 of 4 nitrogen bases
* RNA: slightly different from DNA - other sugar, single stranded, U instead of T
* DNA Replication
    * Every cell has the same DNA (which is copied)
    * Enzyme Helicase unzips your DNA (Strands are used as templates)
    * Primer (starting point) gets added by RNA Primase
    * Leading strand: easier, DNA polymerase just adds missing along upstream direction
    * Lagging strand: wrong direction, has to be done in segments (Okazi fragments), also started with a Primer
    * DNA polymerase replaces primers
    * DNA ligase joins the copied strands together again
