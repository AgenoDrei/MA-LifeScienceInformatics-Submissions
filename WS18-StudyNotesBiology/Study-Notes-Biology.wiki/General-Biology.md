# General Biology Notes

## Mitosis (Cell Splitting)

* Cloning of cells (does happen really often in your body)
* 23 pairs of chromosomes (1 from your dad, 1 from your mother)
* Sex cells are s.c. haploids, they only have half of the information (see Meiosis) 
* Splitting completes everything (23 pairs)
* Interphase is the normal state (before splitting begins)
* Prophase
    * Before this phase the DNA replicates [[Genetics|Genetics#dna-replication]]
    * Chromatids form from the duplicated DNA, Centrosomes is the name of the crossing chromatids
    * Forming of microtubiles
* Metaphase
    * can last up to 20 minutes
    * Chromosome pairs line up along microtubiles (motor proteins)
* Anaphase
    * Chromosome pairs are split apart by the motor proteins -> single chromosome (pull)
    * Genetic material in the chromatids will be used to rebuild the cell (nucleus and all the other stuff)
* Telophase
    * Recreation is done
    * Cells divide (Cleavage) through Cytokinesis, which means cell movement
