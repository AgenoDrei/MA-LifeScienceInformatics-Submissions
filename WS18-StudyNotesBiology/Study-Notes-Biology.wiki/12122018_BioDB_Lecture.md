- Power of naming things
	 - Stuff you understand gets a name
	 - Huge challenge in computational biology (names change, different standards, elements get merged, ...)
	 - How find a general language to map all different naming formats to one database (BEL?)
- General knowledge
	- Mitophage: degradation of Mitochondria
	- Flux: the net movement of particles across a specified area in a specified period of time
- Reactome
	- free, open source, peer-reviewed and curated database
	- advanced technology used -> highly reliable
	- clear scope on molecular reactions and bimolecular pathways
	- search + browsing + analyze functions
	- Browsing
		- Sorted by function:
		Immune System, Signal transactions, Diseases, ...
		- Link between related pathway cartoons (can also jump between completly different function areas)
		- hiearchy based
	- Searching
		- good filtering function
		- detail information: description, participants, orthology, ...
		- grouped by Protein, Funciton, Reaction, ...
		- third party information is included
	- Upload your own overlay data (gets deleted after 7 day of not-usage)
	- Customize the system to your own preference
	- Data analytics
		- Data: Up/Downregulation Genedata
		- Highlighting of relevant pathways
		- Overlay and mapping to the relevant pathways
- Biological Expression Language - BEL
	- used to express relations biology
	- oversimplified
	- no time interpretation
- Options for usage pathway knowledge **Important for EXAM**
	- Count in data, count in graph (GSEA), does ignore regulations / topology
	- compare two experiments (healthy/tumor tissue)
	- Overlay technique: Back mapping of the symbolic representation to genes/proteins/?
